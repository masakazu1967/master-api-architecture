# Controller

This folder contains controllers for the infrastructure layer. Controllers are responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, processing them, and returning appropriate HTTP responses. They act as the entry point for the application's API and delegate the necessary operations to the application and domain layers.

## Responsibilities

Controllers have the following responsibilities:

1. **Handling HTTP Requests**: Controllers receive and process incoming HTTP requests from clients. They extract the necessary data from the request and pass it to the appropriate application services or domain entities for further processing.

2. **Returning HTTP Responses**: After processing the request, controllers generate and return the appropriate HTTP responses to the clients. They ensure that the responses are in the correct format and contain the necessary data.

3. **Delegating Operations**: Controllers delegate the necessary operations to the application and domain layers. They act as intermediaries between the clients and the application's core logic, ensuring that the appropriate actions are taken based on the incoming requests.

## Example

Here is an example of a simple controller in a NestJS application:

```typescript
import { Controller, Get, Post, Body, Param } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppService } from './app.service';

@Controller('example')
export class ExampleController {
  constructor(private readonly appService: AppService) {}

  @Get(':id')
  getExample(@Param('id') id: string): string {
    return this.appService.getExample(id);
  }

  @Post()
  createExample(@Body() createExampleDto: CreateExampleDto): string {
    return this.appService.createExample(createExampleDto);
  }
}
```

In this example, the `ExampleController` handles incoming HTTP requests for the `/example` endpoint. It has two methods: `getExample` for handling GET requests and `createExample` for handling POST requests. The controller delegates the necessary operations to the `AppService` for further processing.
