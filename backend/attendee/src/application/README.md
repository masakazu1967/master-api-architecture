# Application Layer

This folder contains application layer code. The application layer is responsible for orchestrating the use of domain entities to fulfill application requirements. It contains application services, use cases, and other application-specific logic.

## Application Services

Application services are used to coordinate the application's workflow and interact with the domain layer. They handle the application's use cases and ensure that the necessary domain operations are performed.

## Use Cases

Use cases represent specific actions or operations that the application can perform. They define the steps required to achieve a particular goal or outcome within the application. Use cases are implemented as methods within application services.
