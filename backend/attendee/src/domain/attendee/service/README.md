# Domain Service

This folder contains domain services for the domain layer. Domain services are used to encapsulate domain logic that does not naturally fit within entities or value objects. They provide operations that are essential to the domain and can be used by other parts of the application.

## Domain Services

Domain services are stateless and focus on domain logic. They are used to perform operations that involve multiple entities or value objects, or that require complex business rules. Domain services help keep the domain model clean and focused on representing the core business concepts.
