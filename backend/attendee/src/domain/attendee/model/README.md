# Domain Model

This folder contains entity and value object classes for the domain layer. These classes represent the core business logic and rules of the application. They are used to model the real-world concepts and behaviors within the domain.

## Entity Classes

Entity classes are objects that have a distinct identity and lifecycle. They are defined by their attributes and behaviors, and they can change over time. Each entity has a unique identifier that distinguishes it from other entities.

## Value Object Classes

Value object classes are immutable objects that are defined by their attributes rather than their identity. They do not have a unique identifier and are considered equal if their attributes are the same. Value objects are used to represent concepts that do not have a distinct identity, such as dates, money, or measurements.
